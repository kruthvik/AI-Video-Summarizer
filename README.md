# AI-Video-Summarizer
Simple UI interface to summarize YouTube videos in a format that users don't have to watch the video to understand.

Uses Flask to set up a local interface, but online interface coming soon. 

## Usage

```
pip install requirements.txt
```
```
./main.bat
```
It will prompt the creation of a localhost website to use the GUI.
